From Amy Gahran of the [Knight Digital Media Center](http://www.knightdigitalmediacenter.org/):

> Civic hacking is not just about computers. The St. Louis Business Journal
> reported that the winning team at the St. Louis civic hackathon proposed a
> phone-based system to let local homeless shelters better coordinate their
> available space, and also to let homeless people quickly find an available
> bed for the night. An impromptu but valuable advisor to this project was a
> janitor in the building where the hackathon was held: he volunteered after
> his shift to explain to the hackers the process a homeless person in that
> city usually goes through to find a shelter spot.
