> "I'd love to see the app able to find food banks, soup kitchens, counselors,
> educational resources, public internet access stations, and more," says Cape
> Girardeau, Missouri-based developer Kerrick Long, who worked on the app with
> two teammates. "I'd also like it to be accessible over voice, SMS, or the
> web."

> city services and members of the public. The only public data this civic hack
> uses is location-based. As in Minneapolis, local officials would do well to
> remember that a little data can go a long way.
