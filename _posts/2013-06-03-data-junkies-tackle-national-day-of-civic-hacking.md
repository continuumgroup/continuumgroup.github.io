From the [St. Louis Business Journal](http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/):

> The winning team proposed a phone-based system that would allow local
> homeless shelters to better coordinate their available space and to allow
> homeless people to quickly check which shelter had beds for the night.
>
> And the team got some help from an unexpected source. James Ware, a janitor
> at the Railway Exchange Building downtown, heard about what the team was
> working on and decided to volunteer after his shift was over. Through working
> at the building, Ware knows a lot about the downtown homeless population and
> he walked the team through the process a homeless person in the city of St.
> Louis usually goes through to find a spot at a shelter for the night.
