From [Examiner](http://www.examiner.com/):

> Barnes is a program associate at Arch Grants, an organization dedicated to
> growth of start-up entrepreneurs in St. Louis. Having never attended a
> hack-a-thon before, she says, she had no way of knowing what to expect. One
> reason she decided to attend was her graduate education in public policy,
> nonprofit management, and community change: but she admits to having no
> background in computer science: “I had spent some time grassroots organizing
> and advocating for public policy initiatives, so I was naturally drawn to the
> merging between technology and data and solving social issues,” she writes.
>
> When asked about the most memorable experience of the hack-a-thon, Barnes
> wrote about the unique dynamic of the team: “It was a great experience
> working on a diverse team, comprised of men and women from many races and age
> groups, with varied skillsets and background, who were all passionate about
> tackling the same social issue. It is exciting to see the group continue to
> work together and build out the project; while the techies actually built the
> program, the team also includes members with experience on building out a
> social program.”
