    Continuum Group began at the 2013 <a href="http://hackforchange.org/">National
    Day of Civic Hacking</a> in Saint Louis, Missouri with a simple idea.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Empower the homeless to better their lives using technology
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This idea attracted a group of people at the hackathon to get together for a
    weekend and start something great. That group, which would eventually become the
    <strong>Continuum Group</strong>, conceived and built a prototype of an automated
    telephone system that could enhance the existing shelter reservation systetm in
    Saint Louis, reducing wait times and staffing costs, while being expanded to
    shelters nation-wide.
